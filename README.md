# upscan-verify

upscan-verify microservice is a part of Upscan module. The service is responsible for polling for files uploaded by
users, scanning these files using ClamAV anti-virus software and moving clean files from inbound AWS S3 bucket (where
these were uploaded by users) to outbound S3 bucket (where files can be fetched by the service that initiated upload).
In case file contains virus, the service stores details of the infection in a separate quarantine S3 bucket, and deletes the infected file.

The microservice is internal component of *Upscan* and external users don't have to interact with it.

Detailed documentation of the *Upscan* can be found here: https://github.com/hmrc/upscan-initiate/blob/master/README.md

# Service configuration

Here is the list of service's configuration properties:

- `aws.useContainerCredentials` - if true, the service will use credentials of hosting EC2 instance to access SQS and SNS (default setting: false)
- `aws.accessKeyId` - AWS key id, not needed when using credentials of hosting EC2 instance
- `aws.secretAccessKey` - AWS secret key, not needed when using credentials of hosting EC2 instance
- `aws.sessionToken` - AWS session token, needed only when service is running locally and uses MFA authentication. Proper value
of the token is set automatically when using aws-profile script
- `aws.sqs.queue.inbound` - address of SQS queue that contains notifications regarding uploads of files to inbound bucket
- `aws.s3.region` - AWS region on which outbound AWS bucket is located (default value is *eu-west-2*)
- `aws.s3.bucket.outbound` - name of the outbound AWS S3 bucket, this bucket will be used to store clean files
- `aws.sqs.queue.visibilityTimeout` - The timeout before an unacknowledged message is retried (See [aws docs](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/sqs/model/ReceiveMessageRequest.Builder.html#visibilityTimeout(java.lang.Integer))). Note, it should be greater than the expected time to process the largest supported message size to avoid parallel processing.
- `aws.sqs.retry.interval` - If a message fails to be processed, it will be returned to the queue with this visibility timeout. This means it will be retried sooner than the global visilibity timeout (see `aws.sqs.queue.visibilityTimeout`)
- `aws.sqs.waitTime` - See [aws docs](https://sdk.amazonaws.com/java/api/latest/software/amazon/awssdk/services/sqs/model/ReceiveMessageRequest.Builder.html#waitTimeSeconds(java.lang.Integer))
- `processingBatchSize` - Number of messages to take off the queue at a time - note the messages are still processed sequentially.

# Running locally

The service relies heavily on AWS infrastructure so that it cannot be run entirely locally.

In order to run the service against one of HMRC accounts (labs, live) you will need to have an AWS accounts with proper
role. See [UpScan Accounts/roles](https://github.com/hmrc/aws-users/blob/master/AccountLinks.md) for details.
The service also requires ClamAV virus scanning software running locally.

## Integration with a running ClamAV

```ClamAvSpec``` is an integration test that requires access to a running clam daemon.
This spec may be run locally via the usual ```sbt it:test```, but integration tests are not enabled for this project during continuous integration builds.

You may run ```clamd``` natively or via the [docker-clamav image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkodockx/docker-clamav).
Either way, the instance must accept connections on the default TCP port (3310).
For docker, simply:
```docker run --rm -d -p 3310:3310 mk0x/docker-clamav:alpine```

The spec requires the instance to be available at the host ```avscan```.
If you are running locally this can be achieved by editing your ```/etc/hosts``` file as follows:

```127.0.0.1       avscan```

If you are using Docker Machine on a Mac then the host IP should be the IP of your Docker Machine.

```DOCKER_IP       avscan```


## Setting up AWS credentials

Prerequisites:
- AWS accounts with proper roles setup
- Proper AWS credential configuration set up according to this document [aws-credential-configuration](https://github.com/hmrc/aws-users), with the credentials below:
```
[upscan-service-prototypes-engineer]
source_profile = webops-users
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
output = json
region = eu-west-2
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::638924580364:mfa/your.username
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::415042754718:role/RoleServicePrototypesEngineer

[webops-users]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::638924580364:mfa/your.username
region = eu-west-2
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::415042754718:role/RoleServicePrototypesEngineer
```
- Working AWS MFA authentication
- Have python 2.7 installed
- Install botocore and awscli python modules locally:
  - For Linux:
```
sudo pip install botocore
sudo pip install awscli
```
  - For Mac (Mac has issues with pre-installed version of ```six``` as discussed [here](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165):
```
sudo pip install botocore --ignore-installed six
sudo pip install awscli --ignore-installed six
```

## Starting the service locally

In order to run the app against lab environment it's neeeded to run the following commands:
```
export AWS_SQS_QUEUE_INBOUND=name_of_inbound_sqs_queue
export AWS_S3_BUCKET_OUTBOUND=name_of_outbound_s3_bucket
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=name_of_proper_profile_in_dot_aws_credentials_file
./aws-profile sbt
```
These commands will give you an access to SBT shell where you can run the service using 'run' or 'start' commands.

# Deployment

The service is different from other services running on MDTP platform. It doesn't live in the MDTP AWS account nor platform's deployment tools like *Docktor* / *orchestrator* Jenkins, instead, it's deployed into Upscan's separate AWS account.

**Important**: When the service runs withing Upscan AWS account, it takes AWS credentials from hosting EC2 instance. Using EC2 instace credentials is enabled by setting `aws.useContainerCredentials` property to `true`.

`upscan-verify` is deployed using the Terraform in `upscan-infrastructure`, refer to the [README](https://github.com/hmrc/upscan-infrastructure#upscan-infrastructure) for instructions.

# Tests

Upscan service has end-to-end acceptance tests which can be found in https://github.com/hmrc/upscan-acceptance-tests repository
